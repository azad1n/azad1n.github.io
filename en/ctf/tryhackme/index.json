Category Machine Learning / Adversarial Attacks Points 500 Difficulty Medium Maker kohiro Summary Attack CCN:\nIn this challenge, we explored the vulnerabilities of two object detection models, YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 by crafting an adversarial image that causes the models to disagree on predictions with a significant confidence gap. Using insights gleaned from their confusion matrices, we identified weak spots in classification consistency and exploited them using image transformations like noise injection, blurring, color shifting, and rotations.\nBy systematically perturbing a source image and evaluating predictions in a loop, we found a transformation that met both conditions:\nThe two YOLO versions predicted different object classes The absolute difference in their confidence scores exceeded 0.4 This adversarial example reveals real-world concerns in machine learning systems: even small, natural-looking perturbations can cause models to behave inconsistently, especially across versions. The challenge highlights the importance of model robustness, adversarial testing, and version-aware validation pipelines in production-grade ML systems.\nDescription Did u know how to attack CNN?\n1 2 different_prediction = result_v8[\u0026#34;class_name\u0026#34;] != result_v10[\u0026#34;class_name\u0026#34;] confidence_gap = abs(result_v8[\u0026#34;confidence\u0026#34;] - result_v10[\u0026#34;confidence\u0026#34;]) \u0026gt;= 0.4 Challenge files: Download Model Files\nWhat we have We were provided the following both the confusion matrixes for YOLOv8 and YOLOv10, and with the erialized PyTorch models (presumably YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 checkpoints), and a web endpoint: http://chal.78727867.xyz:5000/\nThe challenge description also says :\n1 2 different_prediction = result_v8[\u0026#34;class_name\u0026#34;] != result_v10[\u0026#34;class_name\u0026#34;] confidence_gap = abs(result_v8[\u0026#34;confidence\u0026#34;] - result_v10[\u0026#34;confidence\u0026#34;]) \u0026gt;= 0.4 So the goal is to upload a single adversarial image that causes the two YOLO versions to predict different classes, and also have a confidence difference of at least 0.4.\nThis tests not just adversarial crafting skills, but also model drift exploitation, where different versions of a CNN interpret visual noise differently.\nConfusion Matrix Analysis To make a precise, low-effort, high-yield adversarial image, we first analyze the model weaknesses.\nYOLOv8 Confusion Matrix This matrix shows how often YOLOv8 correctly classifies traffic signs. Most classes are well-classified, with very high diagonal values (~0.9+). For example:\nSpeed Limit 120 → 92% correct Stop → 100% correct Green Light → 80% correct But there are some off-diagonal cells with non-zero values, indicating misclassifications:\nRed Light is misclassified as background: 22% Speed Limit 90 has 9% misclassified as background Meaning: High accuracy across most classes, very \u0026ldquo;confident\u0026rdquo; and robust. Stop and Speed Limit 120 are almost perfectly predicted. Background confusion is low. Good candidate for a baseline (resistant model).\nYOLOv10 Confusion Matrix YOLOv10 is more error-prone:\nLower accuracy for Speed Limit 50 (only 83%) Speed Limit 90 → 68% correct (vs 79% in v8) Background misclassifications are more frequent Also, notice that:\nGreen Light has more misclassified to background (25%) than YOLOv8 (19%) Stop has a tiny error (0.01) vs v8\u0026rsquo;s 0 Meaning: Generally less confident. Speed Limit 50, Speed Limit 90, and Green Light show significant confusion. More background misclassifications — weaker in separating signs from noise.\nTLDR Class YOLOv8 Accuracy YOLOv10 Accuracy Notes Stop 100% 99% Close, but v10 is worse Speed Limit 90 79% 68% v10 significantly worse Speed Limit 50 92% 83% v10 worse again Green Light 80% 74% More misclassifications So, if we want to find a target for adversarial attack, we\u0026rsquo;d look at:\nSpeed Limit 90 Speed Limit 50 Green Light Or others with bigger confusion differences We should take a sign that YOLOv8 predicts well, and find a transformation that throws YOLOv10 off. Alternatively, we look for signs where YOLOv10 is overly confident but wrong.\nFrom the matrices, Speed Limit 90, Green Light, and Red Light stood out. We\u0026rsquo;ll focus our adversarial transformations there.\nWhat is this about?! What Is the Core Problem (Adversarial ML)\nWe were tasked with creating what\u0026rsquo;s called an adversarial image.\nAdversarial image: An image that looks normal to a human, but fools a model into a wrong or conflicting prediction.\nHere, you\u0026rsquo;re exploiting how model versions differ in behavior:\nYOLOv8 and YOLOv10 might interpret the same image differently Their internal training weights and thresholds differ Even a small change can cause model A to classify \u0026ldquo;Stop Sign\u0026rdquo; and model B to classify \u0026ldquo;Speed Limit 30\u0026rdquo; Exploit I chose a Speed Limit 90 sign (get any image and it will do).\nWe want to:\nApply adversarial noise or image transformations to cause YOLOv10 to flip predictions or reduce confidence. Preserve YOLOv8\u0026rsquo;s confidence and class prediction (or reduce it less aggressively). Automate it to test multiple transforms efficiently. Transformations Used Inspired by adversarial attack papers and data augmentation strategies:\nRotation: [-25°, 25°] Gaussian blur: simulate camera shake Color Jitter: manipulate hue, contrast, and brightness Random Noise: force internal neuron activations to fire inconsistently Exploit walkthrough Requirements Before running the script, install these if not already:\n1 pip install ultralytics pillow requests numpy Next :\n1 2 3 model_v8 = YOLO(\u0026#34;yolo_v8.pt\u0026#34;) model_v10 = YOLO(\u0026#34;yolo_v10.pt\u0026#34;) SOURCE_IMAGE = \u0026#34;sign.jpg\u0026#34;

YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 likely have slightly different weights, training data, or hyperparameters, meaning they respond differently to noise. The transformation pipeline ensured we created images in the decision boundary space — areas where small input changes cause big output changes.\nThis is a textbook black-box adversarial attack.

This is because a relational database can handle a wide range of data formats and process queries efficiently. In addition, it organizes data into tables that can be linked internally based on common data. This allows the user to easily retrieve one or more tables with a single query. On the other hand, a flat file stores data in a single table structure, making it less efficient and consuming more space and memory.\nMost commercially available RDBMSs currently use Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database. RDBMS structures are most commonly used to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete), which are critical to support consistent data management.\nEnumeration after checking port 80, It lead me to nothing, so we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on postgresql for now.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ┌──(azadin㉿kali)-[~/tryhackme] └─$ nmap -p$ports -sC -sV -Pn -n 10.10.89.171 Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-07-04 08:09 UTC Nmap scan report for 10.10.89.171 Host is up (0.089s latency).
